## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sec_scraper_project
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Configure settings:**
Edit `config.py` and update the User-Agent header with your contact information:
```python
HEADERS = {
    "User-Agent": "YourApp/1.0 (your_email@yourcompany.com)",
    # ...
}
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Collect Data
```bash
# Collect proxy statement data for 10 S&P 500 companies
python main_runner.py collect --max-companies 10 --export

# Collect multiple filing types
python main_runner.py collect --filing-types "DEF 14A,13F-HR" --max-companies 5
```

### 2. Validate Data Quality
```bash
# Run comprehensive data validation
python main_runner.py validate --export
```

### 3. Analyze Ownership
```bash
# Generate ownership concentration analysis
python main_runner.py analyze --export
```

### 4. Monitor Compliance
```bash
# Check SEC API compliance status
python main_runner.py compliance --days 7
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Collection
```python
from comprehensive_scraper import ComprehensiveOwnershipScraper

scraper = ComprehensiveOwnershipScraper()
scraper.run_comprehensive_collection(
    indices=['SP500'],
    filing_types=['DEF 14A'],
    max_companies=20,
    max_workers=2
)
```

### Advanced Analysis
```python
from database import OwnershipDatabase

db = OwnershipDatabase()

# Get Big 4 ownership analysis
big4_data = db.get_big4_analysis()
print(f"Big 4 control {big4_data['total_percent'].sum():.1f}% of analyzed companies")

# Calculate concentration metrics
metrics = db.calculate_concentration_metrics('AAPL')
print(f"AAPL HHI: {metrics['hhi']}")
```

### Custom Validation
```python
from data_validator import OwnershipDataValidator

validator = OwnershipDataValidator()
ownership_data = db.get_ownership_summary()

report = validator.generate_data_quality_report(ownership_data)
print(f"Data completeness: {report['validation_results']['market']['metrics']['overall_data_completeness']:.1f}%")
```

## Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with the following key tables:

- **companies**: Company information (ticker, CIK, sector)
- **holders**: Institutional investor details with normalized names
- **filings**: SEC filing metadata and processing status
- **ownership**: Ownership positions with shares/percentages
- **concentration_metrics**: Calculated concentration measures
- **request_log**: API compliance monitoring

## Configuration

Key configuration options in `config.py`:

```python
# Rate limiting
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 10
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_DAY = 100000

# Filing types to process
FILING_TYPES = {
    'DEF 14A': {'priority': 1, 'frequency': 'annual'},
    '13F-HR': {'priority': 2, 'frequency': 'quarterly'},
    # ...
}

# Institutional investor aliases
INSTITUTIONAL_ALIASES = {
    'Vanguard Group': ['The Vanguard Group, Inc.', ...],
    'BlackRock': ['BlackRock, Inc.', ...],
    # ...
}
```

```

2. **Parsing Failures**
```bash
# Run validation to identify issues
python main_runner.py validate

# Check debug files in data/ directory
ls data/*_proxy.html
```

3. **Database Errors**
```bash
# Check database integrity
sqlite3 data/ownership.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

# Reset database if corrupted
rm data/ownership.db
python main_runner.py collect --max-companies 1
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable verbose logging
python main_runner.py collect --verbose

# Check log files
tail -f logs/scraper.log
```
